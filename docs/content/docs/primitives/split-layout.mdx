# Split-Layout

Multi-split layout primitive.
Provides a tree of resizable splits that yields pane rectangles for rendering.

This type only calculates layout geometry. For interactive resizing with mouse drag, use the
[`SplitLayoutWidget`](../widgets/split-layout) wrapper.

## Non-interactive by design

- `SplitLayout` does not handle mouse events.
- Use `SplitLayoutWidget` with `SplitLayoutWidgetState` to enable hover/drag resizing.

## Setting initial split sizes

Use `resize_divider` when you have a pane id and want to set that pane's percentage of its split.
Use `resize_split` when you already know the split node index.

```rust
use ratatui_toolkit::primitives::split_layout::SplitLayout;

let mut layout = SplitLayout::new(0);
let right_pane = layout.split_pane_horizontally(0).unwrap();

// Give the right pane 20% of the split.
let _ = layout.resize_divider(right_pane, 20);
```

## Example
```rust
use ratatui_toolkit::primitives::split_layout::SplitLayout;

let mut layout = SplitLayout::new(0);
let _ = layout.split_pane_vertically(0);
```
