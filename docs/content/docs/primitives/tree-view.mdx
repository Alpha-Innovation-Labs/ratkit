# Tree-View

Tree view widget for hierarchical data display.
This module provides a complete tree view implementation with:
- `TreeNode` - Hierarchical data structure for tree nodes
- `NodeState` - State information for rendering nodes
- `TreeViewState` - Selection, expansion, and filter state
- `TreeView` - The main widget (takes ownership of nodes)
- `TreeViewRef` - Widget that borrows nodes (avoids cloning)
- `TreeNavigator` - Keyboard navigation with configurable keybindings
- `TreeKeyBindings` - Customizable keybindings for navigation
## Example
```rust
use ratatui_toolkit::tree_view::{TreeNode, TreeView, TreeViewState};
let nodes = vec![
TreeNode::with_children("Root", vec![
TreeNode::new("Child 1"),
TreeNode::new("Child 2"),
]),
];
let tree = TreeView::new(nodes)
.render_fn(|data, state| {
ratatui::text::Line::from(*data)
});
let mut state = TreeViewState::new();
```
