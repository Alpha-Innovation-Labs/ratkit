# Hotkey

Hotkey registration and management service.
Provides a centralized system for registering, managing, and querying
hotkeys across the application. Supports context-scoped hotkeys,
priorities, and automatic help text generation.
## Example
```rust
use ratatui_toolkit::services::hotkey::{Hotkey, HotkeyRegistry, HotkeyScope};
let mut registry = HotkeyRegistry::new();
Register a global hotkey
registry.register(Hotkey::new("q", "Quit application")
.scope(HotkeyScope::Global));
Register a tab-specific hotkey
registry.register(Hotkey::new("j", "Move down")
.scope(HotkeyScope::Tab("Markdown")));
Get all hotkeys for display
let hotkeys = registry.get_hotkeys();
for hotkey in hotkeys {
println!("{} - {}", hotkey.key, hotkey.description);
}
```
