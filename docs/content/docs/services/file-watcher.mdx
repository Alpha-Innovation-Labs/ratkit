# File-Watcher

File watching service for detecting file system changes.
A reusable, configurable file watcher that can be used across multiple
components in the toolkit. Supports watching single files or entire
directory trees.
## Example
```rust
use ratatui_toolkit::services::file_watcher::{FileWatcher, WatchMode};
use std::path::Path;
Watch a single file
let mut watcher = FileWatcher::for_file().unwrap();
watcher.watch(Path::new("README.md")).unwrap();
In your event loop:
if watcher.check_for_changes() {
println!("File changed!");
}
Watch a directory recursively
let mut dir_watcher = FileWatcher::for_directory().unwrap();
dir_watcher.watch(Path::new("./src")).unwrap();
Get which paths changed
let changed = dir_watcher.get_changed_paths();
for path in changed {
println!("Changed: {}", path.display());
}
```

## Struct: FileWatcher

A file watcher for detecting file system changes.
Uses the `notify` crate internally to watch files and directories
for changes. Provides a non-blocking interface suitable for use
in TUI event loops.
